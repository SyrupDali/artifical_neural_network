# artifical_neural_network
A grocery-robot has no knowledge of what kind of product an apple is. However, it can deter- mine the features of a product using its sensors. Based on features such as the shape, color, weight, and wrapping of a product, it can recognize specific classes.
The problem can be simplified into classification, which can be performed by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 

The task is to code a fully functioning artificial neural network and create a report explaining what we did.
